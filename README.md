## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
cargo install rsnip
```

### Basic Usage

1. Create a snippet:
```bash
rsnip edit --ctype shell  # Opens your default editor
```

2. Add some snippets in the format:
```
--- greeting
Hello {{ env_USER }}!
---

--- backup
tar -czf backup-{{ current_date|strftime('%Y%m%d') }}.tar.gz ./
---
```

3. Use your snippets:
```bash
# List available snippets
rsnip list --ctype shell

# Copy a snippet to clipboard
rsnip copy --ctype shell --input greeting

# Interactive fuzzy search
rsnip complete --ctype shell --interactive
```

### Shell Integration

Add to your `.bashrc`:
```bash
# Optional: Add convenient alias
alias ,="rsnip copy --ctype shell --input"

# Enable tab completion
source /path/to/rsnip.bash
```

Now you can use:
```bash
, back<tab>  # Will fuzzy-find and complete 'backup'
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

RSnip looks for configuration in the following locations:
- `~/.config/rsnip/config.toml`
- `~/.rsnip/config.toml`
- `/etc/rsnip/config.toml`

Example configuration:
```toml
[snippet_types.shell]
source_file = "~/.config/rsnip/shell_snippets.txt"
description = "Shell command snippets"

[snippet_types.git]
source_file = "~/.config/rsnip/git_snippets.txt"
description = "Git commands and workflows"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Template Features

RSnip supports Jinja2-style templates with several built-in filters:

- `strftime`: Format dates - `{{ current_date|strftime('%Y-%m-%d') }}`
- `add_days`: Add days to date - `{{ current_date|add_days(7) }}`
- `subtract_days`: Subtract days - `{{ current_date|subtract_days(7) }}`

Environment variables are available as `env_VARNAME`:
```
--- path
Current path is: {{ env_PATH }}
---
```
